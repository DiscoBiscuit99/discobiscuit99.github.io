My name is Valdemar Høgsvig Lorenzen. Yes, it's nordic. 
I just finished gymnasium and am now working on my personal projects while searching for work and avoiding COVID (ough). 
I've now decided to set up a page utilizing Github Pages during this downtime. 
As of now, I don't know what this page will become in time; maybe a jumbled, sprawling mess. 
We'll see. Below you'll find my contact information, since that looks professional. 
Oh, and by the way, one can navigate the page using `[h|j|k|l]` for directional scrolling and `[g|G]` for going top and bottom if one so wishes; 
much like vim if you're familiar. 
If you find you like the controls, an addon for the firefox browser, made to work on all webpages, can be downloaded here: 
[Better Scrolling](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/better-scrolling/).

For now, I will be migrating my math notes from OneNote to this page. 
(Note: figure out the correct translations before it's too late.
Also, document procedures better.)
