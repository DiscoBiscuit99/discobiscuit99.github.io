<h2>Transporting qi and blood throughout the body and rendering the body an integrated whole</h2>

<p>All organs, sense organs and tissues are nourished, energized and warmed by the qi and blood circulating through the channel network. Using the analogy of a plant, the zangfu may be perceived as the roots of the channels, the channels themselves as the stems, and the different body tissues, and especially the sense organs, as the flowers. Thus the Heart, for example, is said to &lsquo;flower&rsquo; into the tongue. The zangfu, the channels passing through the limbs and body, and the tissues and sense organs which they nourish therefore constitute an integrated whole.</p>

<p>By virtue of the interconnections between the channels, the zangfu themselves are linked with each other. For example, the primary channel of the Lung originates in the Stomach, and passes through the Large Intestine and diaphragm, whilst the primary channel of the Heart connects with the Small Intestine and Lung.</p>

<p>The channels also link the interior with the exterior, their origin in the depth of the body and their emergence at the surface. Since they run bilaterally, or in the case of the Girdling vessel encircle the body, the primary, divergent, connecting and sinew channels as well as six of the extraordinary vessels, link the two sides of the body, and since they run vertically, the various channels link above with below. The theory of the channels, therefore, underlies one of the most significant discoveries of Chinese medicine; they form the physiological interconnections that render the body an integrated whole rather than a series of independent units.</p>

<h2>Protecting the body</h2>

<blockquote><p>When the pathogen comes to dwell as a guest, first it resides in the skin and body hair. If it remains and does not leave it will enter the minute connecting channels. If it remains and does not leave it well enter the luo-connecting channels. If it remains and does not leave it will enter the channels, reaching the five zang and spreading into the intestines and Stomach.</p>

<p>&mdash; <cite>Essential Questions</cite></p></blockquote>

<p>The various kinds of channels occupy different depths within the body. As well as nourishing and energizing these different layers of the body, the channels serve to prevent the penetration of pathogenic factors that may attack the body from the outside. According to Chinese medicine, wind, cold, damp, heat, fire, and dryness are important causes of disease.</p>

<p>When extreme, or when body resistance is lowered, they can attack the body and easily penetrate to the deeper levels such as the zangfu and the bones and joints. The deeper the penetration towards the zangfu, the more serious the disease becomes.</p>

<p>Part of the function of the channel network is to contain and repel these pathogenic factors, and prevent deeper penetration. Thus, for example, a person who sleeps in a draft may wake with a stiff and painful neck. The wind and cold will usually in this instance have injured only the more superficial portions of the channel network, i.e. the sinew channels, causing local stagnation of qi and blood. Treatment, whether by acupuncture, cupping, or massage will relatively easily eliminate the pathogenic factor.</p>

<p>If, however, a person is frequently exposed to wind, cold, and damp, then over time the pathogenic factors will not be contained at the level of the superficial channels, but may penetrate deeper into the body, injuring the joints, sinews and bones. If even more prolonged, the pathogens may injure and weaken the zangfu, most commonly the Liver and Kidneys.</p>

<p>Alternatively, an acute attack of wind and cold may induce the typical symptoms of chills, slight fever, headache, body aches, runny nose etc. Here, the pathogenic factors have injured and caused stagnation of the defensive and nutritive qi in the relatively superficial portion of the body. The treatment principle is to release the exterior. If, however, the pathogenic factors are not contained at the superficial level, but penetrate deeper, they may injure the zangfu, most commonly the Lung, Stomach, Spleen or intestines.</p>

<p>To summarize, the entire channel network serves as a series of barriers to prevent the deeper penetration of pathogenic factors from the exterior. When contained at the exterior, the disease is relatively less serious and easier to eliminate. When the body resistance is lowered, or the pathogenic factor is exceptionally strong or prolonged, and the channels cannot contain the pathogenic factors at the exterior, the disease is relatively more serious and harder to cure.</p>

<h2>Responding to dysfunction in the body</h2>

<p>When the harmony of the body is disrupted by disease, the channels can respond in a number of ways:</p>

<h3>Disease of the channels themselves</h3>

<p>The channels themselves can be diseased giving rise to local tenderness, pain, weakness, distention, numbness, tingling etc. Disease of the channels means impaired flow of qi and blood (i.e. stagnation) or insufficiency of qi and blood leading to malnutrition. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>back sprain due to traumatic injury can give rise to pain, aching, tingling etc. in the channels in the lumbar region and leg.</li>
<li>attack by pathogenic wind and cold into the muscle layers can give rise to stiffness, soreness and aching with points of tenderness, whether acupuncture points or ahshi points.</li>
<li>prolonged exposure to wind-cold-damp may give rise to chronic pain and aching in the limbs and joints.</li>
<li>previous injury or prolonged over-use of any part of the body may give rise either to stagnation or deficiency in the channels in a local area resulting in aching and pain.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Disease of the zangfu reflecting into the channels</h3>

<p>When the zangfu are in disharmony internally, their related channels may also show signs of disorder, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>stasis of Heart blood can give rise to pain which descends along the Heart channel in the arm, or ascends along the Heart channel to the throat.</li>
<li>stagnation of Liver qi can lead to distention and pain in any portion of the Liver channel, or its interiorly-exteriorly related Gall Bladder channel, for example the genitals, lateral costal region, breasts, throat or head.</li>
<li>heat in the Stomach fu may give rise to symptoms such as excessive hunger and vomiting as well as transmitting to the Stomach channel in the head, giving rise to tooth abscess, bleeding gums, ulcers on the tongue etc.</li>
<li>Liver fire can transmit via the Liver channel to the eyes and manifest as redness, soreness and pain.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Disease transmitting via the channels</h3>

<p>Disease can pass from one zangfu to another via the channels, or from one channel to another, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Heart fire can transmit from the Heart channel to its interiorly-exteriorly related hand Small Intestine channel, from the hand taiyang Small Intestine channel to the foot taiyang Bladder channel and thence to the Bladder fu.</li>
<li>severe deficiency of Kidney yang and impaired transformation of body fluids can cause excessive water to overflow to the Lung and/or Heart, both linked to the Kidney via the internal pathway of its primary channel.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Visibly showing disease</h3>

<p>In some cases, the course of a disease channel can be discolored and therefore visible, whether purple showing stasis of blood, red indicating heat, or pale as a result of deficiency of qi and blood.</p>

<h2>The channels serve to transmit qi to the diseased area</h2>

<p>The channels serve to transmit acupuncture stimulation from the acupuncture point to the diseased area of the body, rendering acupuncture treatment effective. By stimulating an acupuncture point by some means, whether by needling, application of heat, pressure, massage or cupping, the qi and blood of the whole course of the channel may be regulated.</p>
