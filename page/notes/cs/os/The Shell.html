<p>A shell is a special program that is usually integrated in an OS distribution, and which offers humans an interface with the computer. The way it appears to users may vary from system to system (command line, file explorer, etc.), but the concept is always the same:
    * Allow a user to select a program to be started, and optionally give it session-specific arguments.
    * Allow trivial operations on the local storage like listing the content of directories, moving and copying files across the system.</p>

<p>In order to complete those actions, the shell may have to issue numerous system calls, like &ldquo;open file &lsquo;x&rsquo;; open file &lsquo;y&rsquo; and create it if it doesn&rsquo;t exist; read content from x, write to y, close both files, write &lsquo;done&rsquo; to standard output&rdquo;.
The shell may also be used by programs that want to start other programs but do not want to do this themselves (e.g. completing file patterns like &ldquo;*.mp3&rdquo;, retrieving the exact path of the program, etc.).</p>

Modern shells can also have various extra features, such as the following:
