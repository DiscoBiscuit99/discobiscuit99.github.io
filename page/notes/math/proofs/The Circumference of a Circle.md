<p>This page outlines an approach to prove the circumference of a circle. <a href="../../../Home.html">(~/)</a></p>

Simply integrating from \\( 0 \\) to \\( 2 \pi \\) in the range of a circles radius yields the circumference of the circle. This can be thought of as a pencil touching the paper at length radius from a center point and rotating about it \\( 2 \pi \\) degrees and, thus, etching the circumference. The integral:

\\[
C = \int_{0}^{2 \pi} r~\mathrm dx 
\\]

\\[ \Downarrow \\]

\\[
C = \left[ rx \right]_0^{2 \pi}
\\]

\\[ \Downarrow \\]

<div class="answer">
\[ C = 2 \pi r \]
</div>

The circumference of the circle can also be obtained by differentiating the area of the circle:

\\[ 
C = \frac{\mathrm dA}{\mathrm dr} \Rightarrow 
C = \pi \cdot 2r 
\\]
