<h2>Reporting An Issue</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re about to raise an issue because you think you&rsquo;ve found a
problem with MathJax, or you&rsquo;d like to make a request for a new
feature in the codebase, or any other reason, please read this first.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/issues">MathJax issue
tracker</a> is the
preferred channel for <a href="#bug-reports">bug reports</a>, <a href="#feature-requests">feature
requests</a>, <a href="#change-requests">change requests</a>, and
<a href="#submitting-pull-requests">submitting pull requests</a>, but please
respect the following restrictions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Please <strong>search for existing issues</strong>. Help us keep duplicate issues
to a minimum by checking to see if someone has already reported your
problem or requested your idea.</p></li>
<li><p>Please <strong>do not</strong> use the issue tracker for personal support
requests (use <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mathjax-users">the MathJax User Group</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Please <strong>be civil</strong>. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the
opinions of others. See also our <a href="#conduct">Conduct Guidelines</a></p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Bug Reports</h3>

<p>A bug is a <em>demonstrable problem</em> that is caused by the code in the
repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful &mdash; thank you!</p>

<p>Guidelines for bug reports:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Use the GitHub issue search</strong> &mdash; check if the issue has already been
reported.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Check if the issue has been fixed</strong> &mdash; look for <a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/issues?q=is%3Aclosed">closed
issues in the current
milestone</a>
or try to reproduce it using the latest <code>develop</code> branch. Please
note that you will need to
<a href="https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/web/hosting.html#getting-mathjax-via-git">compile MathJax and make the components</a>
in order to test MathJax from the source repository.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Share a live sample of the problem</strong> &mdash; without a live page
it is usually impossible to debug problems; see also the <a href="#template">Bug Report
Template</a> below.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isolate the problem</strong> &mdash; a live sample is a starting point
but if you want to speed things up, create a <a href="http://css-tricks.com/6263-reduced-test-cases/">reduced test
case</a>. Be specific
about your setup (browser, OS versions, etc). Use services like
<a href="http://jsbin.com">jsbin</a>, <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>, or
<a href="http://jsfiddle.com">jsFiddle</a> to make collaboration on minimal
test cases easier for everyone.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Include a screenshot/cast as a last resort</strong> &mdash; Is your
issue about a layout or design feature or bug that is hard to reproduce
or isolate? Then please provide a screenshot or screencast. Tools
like <a href="http://www.cockos.com/licecap/">LICEcap</a> or
<a href="http://www.saucelabs.com">SauceLabs</a> allow you to quickly and
easily record a screencasts. If you make it an animated gif, you can
embed it directly into your GitHub issue.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the <a href="#template">Bug Report Template</a> below or <a href="https://github.com/MathJax/MathJax/issues/new?title=Bug%3A&amp;body=%23%23%23%20Issue%20Summary%0A%0A%23%23%23%20Steps%20to%20Reproduce%0A%0A1.%20This%20is%20the%20first%20step%0A%0AThis%20is%20a%20bug%20because...%0A%0A%23%23%23%20Technical%20details%0A%0A*%20MathJax%20Version%3A%20master%20-%20latest%20commit%3A%20%20INSERT%20COMMIT%20REF%0A*%20Client%20OS%3A%20%0A*%20Browser%3A%20%0A*%20">click this
link</a>
to start creating a bug report with the template automatically.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>A good bug report shouldn&rsquo;t leave others needing to request
more information from you. Be sure to include the details of your environment.</p>

<p><a id="template"></a></p>

<p>Template Example (<a href="https://github.com/MathJax/MathJax/issues/new?title=Bug%3A&amp;body=%23%23%23%20Issue%20Summary%0A%0A%23%23%23%20Steps%20to%20Reproduce%0A%0A1.%20This%20is%20the%20first%20step%0A%0AThis%20is%20a%20bug%20because...%0A%0A%23%23%23%20Technical%20details%0A%0A*%20MathJax%20Version%3A%20master%20-%20latest%20commit%3A%20%20INSERT%20COMMIT%20REF%0A*%20Client%20OS%3A%20%0A*%20Browser%3A%20%0A*%20">click to use</a>):</p>

<h3>Feature Requests</h3>

<p>Feature requests are welcome. Before you submit one, be sure to have:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Used the GitHub search</strong> to check that the feature hasn&rsquo;t already
been requested.</li>
<li>Take a moment to think about whether your idea fits with the scope
and aims of the project, or if it might better fit being a <a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-third-party-extensions">custom
extension</a>.</li>
<li>Remember, it&rsquo;s up to <em>you</em> to make a strong case to convince the
project&rsquo;s leaders of the merits of this feature. Please provide as
much detail and context as possible, this means explaining the use
case and why it is likely to be common.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Change Requests</h3>

<p>Change requests cover both architectural and functional changes to how
MathJax works. If you have an idea for a new or different dependency,
a refactor, or an improvement to a feature, etc., please be sure to:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Use the GitHub search</strong> to check that someone else didn&rsquo;t get there first.</li>
<li>Take a moment to think about the best way to make a case for, and
explain what you&rsquo;re thinking. Are you sure this shouldn&rsquo;t really be
a <a href="#bug-reports">bug report</a> or a <a href="#feature-requests">feature
request</a>?  Is it really one idea or is it many?
What&rsquo;s the context? What problem are you solving? Why is what you
are suggesting better than what&rsquo;s already there?</li>
</ol>


<h2>Working on MathJax core</h2>

<p>You want to contribute code? We describe how below.  First, note that
the MathJax source code is in the
<a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-src">https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-src</a> repository, not the
<a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax">https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax</a> repository, which contains the
packaged component files for distribution on CDNs and the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mathjax">mathjax npm
package</a> (the source code is
included in the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mathjax-full">mathjax-full npm
package</a>).</p>

<h3>Key Branches &amp; Tags</h3>

<p>MathJax uses several permanent branches in the <a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-src">MathJax source repository</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-src/tree/develop">develop</a></strong>
is the development branch. All work on the next release happens here
so you should generally branch off <code>develop</code> if you are going to
submit a pull request. Do <strong>NOT</strong> use this branch for a production
site.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-src">master</a></strong> contains the latest
release of MathJax. This branch may be used in production. Do
<strong>NOT</strong> use this branch to work on MathJax&rsquo;s source.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>These branches reflect version 3 of MathJax, which is substantially
different from the version 2 codebase.  Version 2 will continue to be
maintained while web sites transition to version 3, with work being
done using the following branches in the <a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax">MathJax distribution
repository</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/tree/legacy-v2-develop">legacy-v2-develop</a></strong>
is the development branch for changes to the legacy version 2 code.
Any pull requests for version 2 should be branched from here.  Do
<strong>NOT</strong> use this branch for a production site.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/tree/legacy-v2">legacy-v2</a></strong>
is the branch that contains any updates to version 2 following
the release of version 3.  Do <strong>NOT</strong> use this branch to work on
MathJax&rsquo;s source.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In addition to these branches, MathJax uses tags to identify the
various versions.  These can be checked out to obtain the specified
release; for example, <code>git checkout 2.7.5</code> would get you the files for
version 2.7.5 of MathJax.</p>

<p>Note that version 3 is written in Typescript, and so must be compiled
to obtain usable javascript files, and that the components need to be
built once that is done.  See the
<a href="https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/web/hosting.html#getting-mathjax-via-git">documentation</a>
for details. For version 2, the source javascript files are not
compressed until a release is made, so you should use the copies in
the <code>unpacked</code> directory during development.</p>

<h3>Submitting Pull Requests</h3>

<p>Pull requests are welcome. If you&rsquo;re looking to submit a PR for
something that doesn&rsquo;t have an open issue, please consider <a href="#reporting-an-issue">raising an
issue</a> that your PR can close, especially if
you&rsquo;re fixing a bug. This makes it more likely that there will be
enough information available for your PR to be properly tested and
merged.</p>

<h5>Need Help?</h5>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not completely clear on how to submit/update/<em>do</em> Pull
Requests, please check out our <a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/wiki/Source-control-policies">source control
policies</a>. For
more insights, check the excellent in depth <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/wiki/Git-Workflow">Git Workflow
guide</a> from
Ghost, in particular</p>

</ul>


<h3>Testing and Quality Assurance</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re
looking to get involved with the code base and don&rsquo;t know where to
start, checking out and testing a pull request is one of the most
useful things you could do.</p>

<p>These are some <a href="https://gist.github.com/piscisaureus/3342247">excellent
instructions</a> on
configuring your GitHub repository to allow you to checkout pull
requests in the same way as branches.</p>

<h3>Writing documentation</h3>

<p>MathJax&rsquo;s main documentation can be found at <a href="http://docs.mathjax.org">docs.mathjax.org</a>.
The source of the docs is hosted in the
<a href="http://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-docs">mathjax/MathJax-docs</a> repo here on GitHub.</p>

<p>The documentation is generated using
<a href="http://sphinx-doc.org/">Sphinx-doc</a> and hosted on <a href="http://readthedocs.org">Read the
docs</a>.  You can clone the repo and submit pull
requests following the <a href="#submitting-pull-requests">pull-request</a>
guidelines.</p>

<h3>Translation</h3>

<p>If you wish to add or update translations of MathJax, please do it on
<a href="https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translate&amp;group=out-mathjax-0-all">TranslateWiki.net</a>
(and while you&rsquo;re there you can help other open source projects,
too).</p>

<p>For bug reports and other questions that don&rsquo;t fit on
TranslateWiki.net, head over to the
<a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-i18n">mathjax/mathjax-i18n</a>
repository.</p>

<p>The translation files currently are for version 2, as localization
hasn&rsquo;t been added to version 3 yet.</p>

<h2>Conduct</h2>

<p>As a NumFOCUS fiscally sponsored project, MathJax is governed by the
<a href="https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct">NumFOCUS code of conduct</a>,
which we summarize as follows:</p>

<p>We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation,
disability, ethnicity, religion, or similar personal characteristic.</p>

<p>Please be kind and courteous. There&rsquo;s no need to be mean or rude.
Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design
or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There
is seldom a right answer, merely an optimal answer given a set of
values and circumstances.</p>

<p>Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid
ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.</p>

<p>We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass
anyone.  That is not welcome behaviour. We interpret the term
&ldquo;harassment&rdquo; as including the definition in the <a href="https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct#unacceptable-behavior">Unacceptable
Behavior</a>
section of the <a href="https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct">NumFOCUS code of
conduct</a>; if you have any lack
of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read
that definition. In particular, we don&rsquo;t tolerate behavior that
excludes people in socially marginalized groups.</p>

<p>Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you
feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a
community member, please contact one of the channel ops or any of the
<a href="https://github.com/MathJax/MathJax">MathJax</a> core team
immediately. Whether you&rsquo;re a regular contributor or a newcomer, we
care about making this community a safe place for you and we&rsquo;ve got
your back.</p>

<p>Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other
attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome.</p>

<p>We also recommend that you read <a href="http://blog.discourse.org/2013/03/the-universal-rules-of-civilized-discourse/">discourse&rsquo;s
rules</a>
for further suggestions on appropriate behavior.</p>
