        <p>My name is Valdemar Høgsvig Lorenzen. Yes, it's nordic. I just finished gymnasium and am now working on my 
        personal projects while searching for work and avoiding COVID (ough). I've now decided to set up a page 
        utilizing Github Pages during this downtown. As of now, I don't know what this page will become in time; maybe a
        jumbled, sprawling madness. We'll see. Below you'll find my contact information, since that looks professional.</p>
